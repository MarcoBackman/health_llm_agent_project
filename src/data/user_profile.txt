He works as a Software Developer.Physical and Vitals Overview 🩺Alex's physical measurements indicate he is 178 cm (5'10") tall and weighs 85 kg (187 lbs). This results in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 26.9, classifying him as overweight (Reference range for normal BMI is $18.5$ to $24.9$). His core body temperature is $37.0^{\circ}C$.His vital signs are notable:Resting Heart Rate: 72 bpm (normal range).Blood Pressure: 135/88 mmHg. This confirms his active diagnosis of Stage 1 Hypertension, as the reading falls within the $130-139$ (Systolic) or $80-89$ (Diastolic) range.Metabolic Status and Laboratory Findings 🔬Alex exhibits significant dyslipidemia and impaired glucose regulation, which are confirmed by his lab results:Lipid Profile: His Total Cholesterol is high at $225$ mg/dL (Reference: $<200$ mg/dL). This is primarily driven by a high LDL Cholesterol of $150$ mg/dL (Reference: $<100$ mg/dL). Furthermore, his HDL Cholesterol is low at $40$ mg/dL (Reference: $>60$ mg/dL), and Triglycerides are borderline high at $180$ mg/dL (Reference: $<150$ mg/dL).Glucose Regulation: He has clear indicators of Pre-diabetes. His Fasting Glucose is $115$ mg/dL (Reference: $70-99$ mg/dL), and his Hemoglobin A1c is $5.9\%$ (Reference: $<5.7\%$).Renal Function: Creatinine is $0.9$ mg/dL (Reference: $0.6-1.2$ mg/dL), which is Normal.Medical History and Treatment Plan 💊Alex has three primary active diagnoses linked to his lab and physical metrics: Hypercholesterolemia (ICD-10: E78.0), Essential (Primary) Hypertension, Stage 1 (ICD-10: I10), and Pre-diabetes (ICD-10: R73.03). He also manages Mild Seasonal Allergies (ICD-10: J30.9).Current Medications:Lisinopril 10 mg once daily for Hypertension.Simvastatin 20 mg once daily for Hypercholesterolemia.Allergy: He is allergic to Penicillin, which causes a mild rash.Past History: He underwent an Appendectomy at age 12.Family History: His father suffered from Type 2 Diabetes and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), indicating a genetic predisposition to his current metabolic and cardiovascular issues. His mother has Osteoarthritis.Lifestyle Factors and Context 🍎Alex’s lifestyle contributes significantly to his current health profile. His occupation as a Software Developer is largely sedentary.Diet: He reports frequent consumption of processed foods and struggles with vegetable consistency, which directly impacts his lipid and glucose results.Exercise: His physical activity is limited to walking 30 minutes 3-4 times per week.Substance Use: He is a Non-smoker but consumes 4-6 alcoholic drinks per week on average.Summary of Key Risk Factors: Overweight BMI (26.9), Stage 1 Hypertension (135/88 mmHg), Significant Dyslipidemia (High LDL 150 mg/dL, Low HDL 40 mg/dL), Pre-diabetes (A1c 5.9%, Fasting Glucose 115 mg/dL), Sedentary lifestyle, Poor diet, and Strong family history of CAD and Type 2 Diabetes.
